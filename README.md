Final Project App for ECS 189e

# Sprint Planning

## Week 1

Brainstormed several ideas: Chess/Go Fish/Battleship, Trip Pricing app (Maps API), Diablo character stats, Document/Event Organizer.
Created Github repository.
Created Trello board: https://trello.com/b/ap3arKXO/progress.
Drafted proposal together.
Discussed potential ideas moving forward:
1. Levels of difficulty of computer play.
2. Finding inexpensive means of hosting user profile data.
3. Transition view from User A to User B for local device head-to-head play.

Intention of beginning initial programming stages (launch screen, AI design) as early as this weekend/next week.
