Things we need to figure out:
How to display board? UItableview with image background? multiple labels?




Steps to create BattleBoats in Swift:

On init of gameViewController, create the Game class object. Do not assign player types until a game selection is chosen. 

In game object initialization, prepare to add two player objects. Each player object needs to have two boards, their board and their shooting board. 
Let them enter player name if player type is user
if player type is computer give it our own name

init player turn = 0

In board object init, prepare a isHidden variable to show if it is a player's board or view of oppo board.

Need to make ships draggable for setup. Maybe click a square to put front of ship there, have a button above the board to rotate the ship 90 degrees. 

Error handling for ships overlapping, ships hanging over the edge, etc.

Store all boats in array in main game loop file.

When you fire on a square, need to update your firing board (opponents hidden board) and the opponents personal board. 

Need board representation art, hit markers, miss markers.
Ship representations, ship names, and 

Computer can have 3 difficulties. Easy, fires at random. Medium, fires at random, once it hits, searches nearby squares next. Last, cheats at random. 

Need arrays for each player of the squares their ships reside on, the squares that they have fired at.
Need to check on every turn if all ships have been destroyed. 






Screens we will need:
Menu Screen on launch with choices for type of game
Screen for each Player's turn
Screen for intermediate between player turns in pvp on local device
Settings screen to change color palette? 
Username / Login screen?
Scoreboard / etc. screen?
End of game screen
