# Testing Plan for BattleBoats

## What will get tested
### General Gameplay
For the BattleBoats to work as expected, it should behave according to game 
rules which will be tested on. This includes: 
1. the battle should conclude according to the conditions for victory, 
2. the players can only play following the rules, 
3. the game graphics and data are updating after the player's turn
correctly. 

### Play Modes
We are planning to include three different types of gaming method for 
BattleBots: Play locally, single player, and online session. Each game mode 
will need to be tested on different things. 

#### Play Locally
This mode is designed to have two players playing the game on one device. It needs to be tested: 
the players should be able to switch turns correctly using the interface 
provided. (Y/N)

#### Single Player
In this mode, the player will be playing with AI. Items need to be tested on 
is: the AI should behave logically (Y/N and long-form if N)

#### Online Session
Player can choose either starting an online session to hold a game or they 
can join another online session using a code. For this mode, we will ask for 
the player's phone number for them to recieve the generated code. 
1. the player can recieve the code,
2. only two players can join the same session using code
3. the game should continue without major lagging
(All Y/N)

## How to get testers
We are hoping to cooperate with several other groups to test out App. The 
group members will also be testing the App as we develop. We are also 
planning to give friends and family members our phones to test the App.

## How to collect feedback
We are planning to design some google forms for the testers to fill out. The
form will be updated as we progress and we will ask the testers to fill out 
at the end of each testing period. The form will have a page for each mode,
as well as a page to quantify general components on a 1-5 scale (UI, feel, etc)
and provide detailed feedback for iteration.
We are also hoping to set up a discord server for the testers to join and share
their feedback with us.
